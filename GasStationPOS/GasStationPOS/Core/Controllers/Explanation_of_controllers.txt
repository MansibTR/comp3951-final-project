Controllers folder is for handling data or "requests" passed from the form

Purpose of Controller:
-	Controllers is a coordinator of services logic with the UI form logic

-	Handles incoming "requests" from the UI forms, and delegates main business logic to services

-	Does not do data manipulation, it instead delegates that to services

Example:

-	Form uses the functions of the controllers to update database, 
	and gets a value returned or exception, indicating if payment was successful or not

-	Based on that returned value from the controller, the form displays either success view or error view

----

-	Card is selected and "key enter" is confirmed/pressed - the function in the form calls a function in PaymentController

-	It handles any exceptions thrown (thrown if an error occured and payment was not successful) by updating winforms ui to show error message(s)
