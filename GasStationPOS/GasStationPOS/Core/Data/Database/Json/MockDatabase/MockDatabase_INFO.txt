Need to set the properties of the json files in prop. window (or the file cannot be found at runtime):

Set:
-  "Build Action" to "Content"
-  "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy if newer"

----

retail_products.json and fuel_products.json should never be changed
(unless the prices/names change or we add a new product).

They store the data that is displayed in the UI (the buttons), and the price information.
