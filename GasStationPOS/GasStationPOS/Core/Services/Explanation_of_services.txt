Services folder contains business logic of application.

- Displays feature methods to the presenters (ex. IInventoryService has method GetAllRetailProductData)

- Does data manipulation for business logic purposes

- Uses Repository Interfaces for CRUD operations to interact with database

- Converts Models to DTOs and vice versa when getting/retreiving data with the Repository


Examples:

-	Compare user credentials (username and password) with database - to check if a valid user exists (AuthenticationService)

-	Get data to create pdf receipt (ReceiptService)

-	Get product inventory quantity (InventoryService)

----

-	Card is selected and "key enter" is confirmed/pressed - the function in the form calls a function in PaymentController

-	It handles any exceptions thrown (thrown if an error occured and payment was not successful) by updating winforms ui to show error message(s)
