Ran out time to implement.

Data validation folder contains a class DataModelValidator

Contains:

- A Validate method to validate one of the objects in the Models directory, checking the validation data attributes above each of the fields. 
It will throw an exception containing all of the error messages (on error when presenter attempts to set using invalid values).

- (May contain) any data validation methods that cannot be done using validation data attributes.
